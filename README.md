## MSc Projects Repository

This GitHub repository contains a collection of projects completed during my *Master of Science* (MSc) degree at Athens University of Business and Economics. Each project showcases the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the program, covering a range of topics in Applied Statistics. The repository is organized for easy navigation, and each project is housed in its respective directory.

## Project List

### Project 1: [Big Data](https://github.com/KavourEI/AUEB/tree/2d8aa111a17ff9b9a421697c590d4c6e1855f1d3/Big%20Data)
* Description: This course aims how to handle big data, and what are the methodologies one could apply to explore, visualize, understand and of course model this immerse amount of data.
* P.Language: R

### Project 2: [Control Theory](https://github.com/KavourEI/AUEB/tree/2d8aa111a17ff9b9a421697c590d4c6e1855f1d3/Control%20Theory)
* Description: Throughout this course we explore the methodologies of control theory and its applications to real world problems. In this repository, you will come accross an example of coffee bags. I am trying to identify faulty coffee bag production on time, and of course avoid selling the defecting ones.
* P.Language: R 

### Project 3: [Financual Mathematics with Python](https://github.com/KavourEI/AUEB/tree/2d8aa111a17ff9b9a421697c590d4c6e1855f1d3/Financial%20Mathematics%20with%20Python)
* Description: Financial mathematics attempts to capture *ups* and *downs* of stocks and shares. We explore methods to model the movement and predict future values.
* P.Language : Python


### Project 4: [Optimization](https://github.com/KavourEI/AUEB/tree/2d8aa111a17ff9b9a421697c590d4c6e1855f1d3/Optimization)
* Description: During this course we eplore how optimization methods work and should be properly used, like classical numeric methods, guided random search techniques and local greedy searches
* P.Language : R & Python

### Project 5: [Time Series](https://github.com/KavourEI/AUEB/tree/2d8aa111a17ff9b9a421697c590d4c6e1855f1d3/Time%20Series)
* Description: In this course we modeled time series data, and explored methods like AR, MA, ARMA, ARIMA, GARCH and many many more.
* P.Language : R
